# Mirangga Jakti

Backend-focused Software Engineering student specializing in **Python and FastAPI**, 
with a growing interest in **applied Machine Learning**.

I build RESTful backend systems with clean architecture, authentication, and real-world workflows, 
and I am currently exploring how machine learning models can be experimented with, evaluated, 
and integrated into backend systems.
